# Day Planner

## Description
Digitally plan out your work day by logging events and saving them to the planner :) Color-coded time slots help you stay organized and focused.

## Usage
Click on the time slot you want to edit/add an event to, then click the save button to keep it logged in your planner.

## My Planner
